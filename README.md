**General Idea:** To Generate a Q&A Chain Over a Graph Database 

**Overview:** This program allows the user to ask a question (in English) about the data in the graph database, and receive a natural language answer back. This is a basic solution that allows individuals to access technical graph databases in a completely non-technical way.
